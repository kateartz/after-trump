	<p>The <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/prm/ra/admissions/">current screening process for refugees</a> entering the U.S. is one of the most rigorous in our immigration system, taking an average of 1.5 to 2 years to complete and consisting of background checks, interviews, medical evaluations, biometric security checks, and cultural orientation training. Most refugees recieve support to ultimately return to their homes, and <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/us-refugee-resettlement-facts.html">less than 1% of refugees</a> are permanently resettled in other countries. Those who are resettled are typically vulnerable populations including women, children, families, and survivors of violence and torture.</p>

	<p>H.R.193, aka <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/193">the American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2017</a>, has been getting a lot of attention following Donald Trump's inauguration. However, this bill was introduced to the House of Representatives by <a href="https://www.congress.gov/member/mike-rogers/R000575">Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama</a> on January 3rd 2017, 17 days prior to Trump taking office. The bill, which calls for the U.S. to terminate its membership in the United Nations and prohibits any military, political, or financial support of U.N. operations, is now under review by the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/subcommittee/full-committee/">House Committee on Foreign Affairs</a>. The Foreign Affairs Committee will be holding a full committee meeting on Tuesday January 24, 2017.</p>
